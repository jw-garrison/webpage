  title: Scalar implicature and exceptional scope
  abstract: |
    There is lots of work on scalar implicature, lots of work on the
    exceptional scope properties of indefinites, and comparatively little work
    on the scalar implicatures of exceptionally scoping indefinites. This note
    points out that a phenomenon of 'exceptional scalar distributivity'
    suggests that the scalar alternatives of indefinites are more abstract
    than we might have figured: they don't correspond to any actually
    expressible lexemes, and they aren't, strictly speaking, alternatives of
    the indefinite determiner at all! I develop a rudimentary account,
    pointing out various issues, predictions, and choice points along the way.
    I show that two different kinds of theories can be used to explain the
    data: one uses choice functions for exceptional scope, and another uses
    alternatives directly.

  title: Where is the destructive update problem?
  url: http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/jJhMWNlZ/
  abstract: |
    Though much research assumes or argues that there’s a ‘destructive update’
    problem for dynamic accounts of anaphora, it isn’t easy to see what this
    problem is supposed to consist in. There do not, in particular, seem to be
    any problematic empirical predictions associated with destructive update.
    In a sense, this is unsurprising: destructive update of assignments is a
    characteristic feature of how binding is perpetrated in static systems
    (including first-order logic and the λ-calculus). The difference between
    static and dynamic systems isn’t that only dynamic systems allow
    destructive update — it’s that only dynamic systems treat assignment
    functions as bona fide semantic values, as information.

  title: On the semantics of exceptional scope
  url: http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/2JmMWRjY/
  location: "My NYU Ph.D. thesis (Chair: Chris Barker)"
  abstract: |
    I motivate a new theory of exceptional scope phenomena in natural
    language—that is, the ability of some expressions to affect the
    interpretation of others from inside scope islands. I propose that a scope
    island is any domain that is obligatorily evaluated and that exceptional
    scope uniformly reflects linguistic side effects taking scope after the
    evaluation of a scope island.
