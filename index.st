# About me

I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Rutgers Department of Linguistics][1], and
a member of the [Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science][2]. My research is
focused on formal semantics for natural language. My works looks at scope and
binding, questions and indefiniteness, focus, dynamic semantics, continuations
and monads, ellipsis, and their interactions. I'm really interested in how
developments in other disciplines (e.g., category theory and computer science)
can inform linguistic theory, and I've always had a soft spot for direct
interpretation and where syntax stops and semantics begins.

My website's being built right now. Not everything is populated just yet, and
not everything that's up is necessarily where or as it should be. But feel
free to poke around in the meantime.
